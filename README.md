# Find-the-secrets-of-the-land
The sequel to ["Escape the underground cell"](https://github.com/ninjasmosa/Escape-the-underground-cell). Currently under construction.

## Info
Now that you have escaped the cell you were trapped in, you begin your quest to find out who was behind this and ultimately take them out.

## How to play
It is recommended you play the prequel ([Escape the underground cell](https://github.com/ninjasmosa/Escape-the-underground-cell)) before this one to get the best experience.

Currently, there is no way to play this game short of downloading a local copy of the .py file and running it on your own machine. The game is currently unfinished and probably will be for a while.
